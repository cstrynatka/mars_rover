# mars_rover
We were assigned an exercise where we a Mars Rover could move in four different directions-- north, south, east, west -- and a discrete number of spaces. 

My job was to write Ruby code that, depending on what the user typed into Terminal, directed the Mars Rover to a pre-determined set of co-ordinates. I also had to write code that displayed the information of every move that was made.
